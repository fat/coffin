#Coffin - v1.0.0

Coffin is a UI component built on top of the [Skeleton framework](//github.com/dhgamache/Skeleton). It aims to provide a simple, collapsible left shelf. Coffin is fully responsive and automatically collapses in mobile views - allowing you to swipe away and toggle a nagivation in and out of view. It behaves similar to facebook/path's navigation UI.
